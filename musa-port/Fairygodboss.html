            <p>
                Fairygodboss’ previous home page wasn’t clearly communicating the company’s value prop, which was affecting the conversion rate of first time visitors into returning users. It was also in need of an aesthetic update. 

             <br> <br>   Our hypothesis was that a clearly communicated value prop and updated look would attract more people who want to participate in the community, leading to higher conversion and engagement of new users.  

             <br> <br>   Our goal was to increase conversions of first time visitors into members by 67%.

                Fairygodboss is a platform for early to mid career professional women in the US.

              <br> <br>  Internally, we have 4 distinct types of users that interact with our product: consumers, creators, contributors, and jobseekers. The home page was redesigned to specifically address these 4 users’ needs.

          <p>
            One challenge in being tasked with designing a new visual direction for the site was how to update and modernize the look and feel of our home page, without straying too far from what users will experience on the rest of the platform. 

            <br> <br>  Using styles and components from the Design System that our design team was working to build out helped shape a foundation for consistency.

          <p>
            Another hurdle I faced was in how to use imagery on the site. It was important to back up our messaging by showing photos of real and diverse women, but we didn’t have much recent or web-ready photography, and wanted to avoid using generic stock photos.

            <br> <br>  We tested 3 variations of the home page, switching out the imagery above the fold to see which resonated better with users, which established more trust, and which better communicated our offering. The photo of our CEO was the clear winner.

            With a high-fidelity prototype, we conducted more  user testing of the new concept side by side with the old site, and were able to get user validation that we had taken the right direction in the redesign. We were communicating value, compelling a higher rate of users to sign up, and eliciting a stronger positive emotional response to the new page.
